Over 17.7 million people died\\nfrom CVDs which is an about 31% of all deaths, and over 75% of these deaths\\noccur in low- and middle-income countries.[50] Arrhythmia is a representa-\\ntive type of CVDs that refers to any irregular change from the normal heart\\nrhythms. There are several types of arrhythmia including atrial ﬁbrillation,\\npremature contraction, ventricular ﬁbrillation, and tachycardia. Although sin-\\ngle arrhythmia heartbeat may not have a serious impact on life, continuous\\narrhythmia beats can result in fatal circumstances. For example, prolonged\\npremature ventricular contractions (PVCs) beats occasionally turn into a ven-\\ntricular tachycardia (VT) or a ventricular ﬁbrillation (VF) beats which can\\nimmediately lead to the heart failure. Thus, it is important to periodically\\nmonitor the heart rhythms to manage and prevent the CVDs. Electrocardio-\\ngram (ECG) is a non-invasive medical tool that displays the rhythm and status\\nof the heart. Therefore, automatic detection of irregular heart rhythms from\\nECG signals is a signiﬁcant task in the ﬁeld of cardiology.\\nSeveral methods have been presented in the literature for ECG arrhythmia\\nclassiﬁcation. Firstly, we summarized the literature that used the feed-forward\\nneural networks (FFNN) as the classiﬁer. Linh et al[27] presented fuzzy neu-\\nral network model which applied Hermite function for the feature extraction.\\nG¨ uler et al[10] also proposed FFNN as the classiﬁer and WT for the feature\\nextraction which used Lavenberg-Marquard algorithm for the training. Ceylan\\net al[3] proposed FFNN as the classiﬁer, principal component analysis (PCA)\\nand wavelet transform (WT) for the feature extractions, and fuzzy c-means\\nclustering (FCM) method for the feature reduction. As a result, they con-\\ncluded that combination of PCA, FCM, and FFNN achieved the best result\\nwith 10 diﬀerent arrhythmias. Detection of four diﬀerent arrhythmias with av-\\nerage 96.95% accuracy was obtained. Haseena et al[11] introduced FCM based\\nprobabilistic neural network (PNN) and achieved near 99% average accuracy\\nwith eight diﬀerent types of arrhythmia. Besides above literatures, [48,49,36,\\n17,16,19] also applied diﬀerent FFNNs as the classiﬁer with various feature\\nextraction and feature elimination methods.\\nSupport vector machine (SVM) is also widely applied classiﬁcation method\\nin ECG arrhythmia detection. Osowski et al[33] introduced SVM as the classi-\\nﬁer which used higher order statistics (HOS) and Hermite function as the fea-\\nture extraction. Song et al[42] presented a combination of linear discriminant\\nanalysis (LDA) with SVM for six types of arrhythmia. Polat and G¨ unes[35]\\nproposed least square SVM (LS-SVM) with PCA reducing 279 features into 15\\nfeatures. Melgani and Bazi[29] proposed SVM with particle swarm optimiza-\\ntion (PSO) for the classiﬁer and compared their result with K-nearest neighbor\\n(K-NN) and radial basis function (RBF) neural network classiﬁers. As a re-\\nsult, they achieved 89.72% overall accuracy with six diﬀerent arrhythmias.\\nDutta et al[8] introduced cross-correlation based feature extraction method\\nwith LS-SVM classiﬁer. Deasi et al[6] proposed ﬁve diﬀerent arrhythmia de-'),\n",

As a result, the model\\nachieved 98.06% average accuracy with four diﬀerent arrhythmias. Kumar and\\nKumaraswamy[25] introduced random forest tree (RFT) as the classiﬁer which\\nused only RR interval as a classiﬁcation feature.

Jun et al[18] also introduced\\nK-NN which proposed parallel K-NN classiﬁer for the high-speed arrhythmia\\ndetection. Related to this paper, Kiranyaz et al[22] introduced one-dimensional\\nCNN for the ECG arrhythmia classiﬁcation. The similarity exists in the use of\\nCNN classiﬁers, but unlike our method of applying CNN to two-dimensional\\nECG images, Kiranyaz’s method applied CNN to one-dimensional ECG sig-\\nnals, and our method is superior in performance. Rajpurkar et al[37] also\\nproposed a 1-D CNN classiﬁer that used deeper and more data than the CNN\\nmodel of Kiranyaz. Despite using a larger ECG dataset, the arrhythmia di-\\nagnostic performance is much lower than the literature. The reason is that\\nalthough the size of the dataset is increased, the ECG signal used as an input\\nremains in one dimension, so the performance improvement is not great even\\nwith deep CNN.\\nAlthough a number of the literature were proposed for the ECG arrhyth-\\nmia classiﬁcation, they have one or more of the following limitations: 1) good\\nperformance on carefully selected ECG recordings without cross-validation,\\n2) ECG beat loss in noise ﬁltering and feature extraction schemes, 3) lim-\\nited number of ECG arrhythmia types for the classiﬁcation, 4) relatively low\\nclassiﬁcation performance to adopt in practical.\\nIn this paper, we ﬁrstly propose an ECG arrhythmia classiﬁcation method\\nusing deep two-dimensional CNN with grayscale ECG images. By transforming\\none-dimensional ECG signals into two-dimensional ECG images, noise ﬁltering\\nand feature extraction are no longer required. This is important since some of\\nECG beats are ignored in noise ﬁltering and feature extraction. In addition,\\ntraining data can be enlarged by augmenting the ECG images which result in\\nhigher classiﬁcation accuracy. Data augmentation is hard to be applied in pre-\\nvious literature since the distortion of one-dimensional ECG signal could down-\\ngrade the performance of the classiﬁer. However, augmenting two-dimensional\\nECG images with diﬀerent cropping methods helps the CNN model to train\\nwith diﬀerent viewpoints of the single ECG images. Using ECG image as an\\ninput data of the ECG arrhythmia classiﬁcation also beneﬁts in the sense of\\nrobustness. Current ECG arrhythmia detection methods are sensitive to the\\nnoise signal since every ECG one-dimensional signal value is treated to have an\\nequal degree of the classiﬁcation.

Furthermore, detecting ECG arrhythmia with ECG images re-\\nsembles how medical experts diagnose arrhythmia since they observe an ECG\\ngraph from the patients throughout the monitor, which shows a series of ECG\\nimages. In other words, the proposed scheme can be applied to the medical\\nrobot that can monitors the ECG signals and helps the experts to identify\\nECG arrhythmia more precisely.\\nOur classiﬁcation method consists the following steps: data acquisition,\\nECG data pre-processing, and CNN classiﬁer. ECG signal data treated in\\nthis paper is obtained from the MIT-BIH database which is generally used\\nas an arrhythmia database in ECG arrhythmia classiﬁcation research. With\\nthese ECG recordings, we transformed every single ECG beat into 128 x 128\\ngrayscale image since our CNN model requires two-dimensional image as an\\ninput. Diﬀerent from the previous ECG arrhythmia classiﬁcation works, our\\ninput data does not need to be separated into an exact single beat. In other\\nwords, even though additional signals from previous and afterward beats are\\nin the image, our CNN model can automatically ignore those noise data when\\nlearning the model. Finally, the CNN classiﬁer is optimized to classify eight\\ndiﬀerent types of ECG beats as follows: normal beat (NOR), premature ven-\\ntricular contraction beat (PVC), paced beat (PAB), right bundle branch block\\nbeat (RBB), left bundle branch block beat (LBB), atrial premature contrac-\\ntion beat (APC), ventricular ﬂutter wave beat (VFW), and ventricular escape\\nbeat (VEB). Since the majority of the ECG signals in the MIT-BIH database\\nis the normal beat, we augmented seven other arrhythmia beats by cropping\\nthe image in nine diﬀerent ways at the training phase. By using the proposed\\naugmentation, our model achieved more than 5% higher weighted average sen-\\nsitivity in the three arrhythmia types, premature contraction beat, ventricular\\nﬂutter wave, and ventricular escape beat, without any modiﬁcation in CNN\\nmodel. In addition to data augmentation, we optimized our CNN model with\\nmodern deep learning techniques such as batch normalization[15], dropout[43],\\nand Xavier initialization[9]. The performance of the proposed classiﬁer was\\nevaluated with TensorFlow with the support of high-end NVIDIA GPUs. As\\na result, our CNN classiﬁer achieved 99.05% average accuracy, 99.57% speci-\\nﬁcity, 97.85% average sensitivity, and 98.55% average positive predictive value\\nwhile 10-fold cross validation method is applied to the evaluation to precisely\\nvalidate the proposed classiﬁer which involves every ECG recording as a test\\ndata.\\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows.

CNN was\\nﬁrst introduced by LeCun et al.[26] in 1989 and was developed through a\\nproject to recognize handwritten zip codes. The existing feed-forward neural\\nnetwork was not suitable for image classiﬁcation since there is an exponential\\nincrease in the number of free parameters because the raw image is directly\\nprocessed without considering the topology of the image. With the advent of\\nthe CNN model, correlation of spatially adjacent pixels can be extracted by\\napplying a nonlinear ﬁlter and by applying multiple ﬁlters, it is possible to\\nextract various local features of the image. The reason why we applied 2D\\nCNN by converting the ECG signal into ECG image form in this paper is that\\n2D convolutional and pooling layers are more suitable for ﬁltering the spatial\\nlocality of the ECG images. As a result, higher ECG arrhythmia classiﬁcation\\naccuracy can be obtained. In addition, the physician judges the arrhythmia in\\nECG signal of the patient through vision treatment through eyes. Therefore\\nwe concluded that applying the 2D CNN model to the ECG image is most\\nsimilar to the physician’s arrhythmia diagnosis process.\\nThere are several successful CNN models of the ImageNet Large Visual\\nPerception Challenge (ILSVRC)[38], a competition for detecting and classify-\\ning objects in a given set of images.

In other words, we can achieve both high\\nspeciﬁcity and sensitivity by augmenting and balancing input data. In this\\nwork, we augmented seven ECG arrhythmia beats (PVC, PAB, RBB, LBB,\\nAPC, VFW, VEB) with nine diﬀerent cropping methods: left top, center top,\\nright top, center left, center, center right, left bottom, center bottom, and right\\nbottom. Each cropping method results in two of three sizes of an ECG im-\\nage, that is 96 x 96. Then, these augmented images are resized to the original\\nsize which is 128 x 128. Fig.4 shows nine example cropped images with the\\noriginal image with PVC. These augmented images are produced inside the\\nmodel since copying these images from the disk increases the time spent on\\nmemory copy between the main memory and GPU memory, which result in\\nslow learning speed.\\nFig. 4 Original PVC image and nine cropped images'),\n",

Therefore, intelligent weight ini-\\ntialization is required to achieve convergence. In CNN, these weights are repre-\\nsented as kernels (or ﬁlters) and a group of kernels forms a single convolution\\nlayer. Our proposed CNN model uses the Xavier initialization. This initializer\\nbalances the scale of the gradients roughly the same in all kernels. The weights\\nare randomly initialized in the following range:\\nx =\\n√\\n6\\nIn +Out ; [−x,x ] (2)\\nWhere In and Out are the number of input and output units at the kernel\\nweights.\\nIn other times, the CNN model usually starts with large size kernel with\\na small size depth and end with small size kernel with a large size depth.\\nHowever, nowadays it is known that small size kernel with deeper layers is\\nbetter than the previous approach. Therefore, we initialized our kernel size\\nwith 3 x 3 which is generally used in modern CNN classiﬁer. We also include\\na zero-padding procedure to maintain the original size of the image after by-\\npassing the convolution layer.\\n2.2.3 Activation function\\nThe role of activation function is to deﬁne the output value of kernel weights in\\nthe model. In modern CNN models, nonlinear activation is widely used, includ-\\ning rectiﬁed linear units (ReLU), leakage rectiﬁed linear units (LReLU)[28],\\nand exponential linear units (ELU)[5]. Although ReLU is the most widely\\nused activation function in CNN, LReLU and ELU provide a small negative\\nvalue because ReLU translates whole negative values to zero, which results in\\nsome nodes no longer participate in learning. After the experiment, we used\\nELU which showed better performance for ECG arrhythmia classiﬁcation than\\nLReLU. ReLU, LReLU, and ELU are shown in following:\\nReLU(x) =max(0,x ) (3)\\nLReLU(x) =max(0,x ) +αmin(0,x ) (4)\\nELU (x) =\\n{ x if x ≥ 0\\nγ(exp(x)− 1) if x< 0 (5)\\nWhere the value of leakage coeﬃcient (α) is 0.3 and the value of the hyper-\\nparameter(γ) is 1.0.'),\n",

Typical normalization methods are L1 and L2 normal-\\nization, however, it is common to apply dropout and batch normalization in\\nrecent deep CNN models. In deep learning, when a layer is deepened, a small\\nparameter change in the previous layer can have a large inﬂuence on the in-\\nput distribution of the later layer. This phenomenon is referred to as internal\\ncovariate shift. Batch normalization has been proposed to reduce this internal\\ncovariate shift, and the mean and variance of input batches are calculated,\\nnormalized, and then scaled and shifted. The location of batch normalization\\nis usually applied just before the activation function and after the convolu-\\ntion layer. However, from our experience, in some cases, it is better to place\\nthe batch normalization layer after the activation function, and the ECG ar-\\nrhythmia classiﬁcation is the case in this case. Therefore, we applied a batch\\nnormalization layer immediately after every activation function in the model,\\nincluding the convolutional block and the fully-connected block.\\nDropout is a way to avoid overﬁtting with reducing the dependency be-\\ntween layers by participating nodes of the same layer probabilistically. In the\\ntraining phase, Dropout does intentionally exclude some networks in learning,\\nso the model can achieve the voting eﬀect by the model combination. In this\\npaper, we applied a dropout with a probability of 0.5 and placed its position\\nafter the batch-normalization layer of the fully-connected block. In general,\\nDropout is not applied to convolutional blocks because convolutional layers\\ndo not have many free-parameters and co-adaptation between nodes is more\\nimportant than reducing the overﬁtting.\\n2.2.5 Cost and optimizer function\\nThe cost function is a measure of how well the neural network is trained and\\nrepresents the diﬀerence between the given training sample and the expected\\noutput. The cost function is minimized by using optimizer function. There are\\nvarious types of cost functions, but deep learning typically uses a cross-entropy\\nfunction.\\nC =− 1\\nn\\n∑\\n[y lna + (1−y) ln(1−a)] (6)\\nWhere n is the number of training data (or the batch size),y is an expected\\nvalue, and a is an actual value from the output layer.\\nTo minimize the cost function, a gradient descent-based optimizer function\\nwith a learning rate is used. There are several well-known optimizer functions\\nsuch as Adam[21], Adagrad[7], and Adadelta[51]. The ﬁnal performance dif-\\nference between the above functions was not large, but in our experiments, it\\nwas found that the optimal point reached the earliest when Adam was used.\\nAs result, we used the Adam optimizer function with an initial learning rate\\nof 0.001 and 0.95 decay per 1,000 steps.'),\n",

This indicates that the pro-\\nposed model achieved the best accuracy in classifying the arrhythmia while\\npresents similarly the highest accuracy in predicting the normal beat. Inter-\\nestingly, the VGGNet shows the worst result compared to other two CNN\\nmodels. The main diﬀerence between the VGGNet and the other models is\\nthe number of pooling layers. After bypassing four pooling layers, the size of\\nECG image is reduced to 8 x 8. Although the VGGNet has twice more the\\nnumber of kernels at the last convolutional layer, it seems that last feature\\nsize with 16 x 16 is more stabilized one. Therefore, when using the ECG im-\\nage size with 128 x 128, we recommend using no more than three pooling\\nlayers in CNN model. Between the proposed model and the AlexNet with\\ndata augmentation, the diﬀerence between the average sensitivities is 0.77%.\\nThis is a quite large diﬀerence when we look into detailed sensitivities of the\\nseven diﬀerent arrhythmias. Table7 describes a detailed evaluation of sensi-\\ntivity with seven types of arrhythmia beats in proposed methods. From the\\nTable7, we can observe that APC, VFW, and VEB arrhythmia classes gain\\nlarge beneﬁts from the data augmentation which has relatively less ECG data\\nthan other arrhythmia classes.

Over 100,000 ECG beat images are obtained\\nwith eight types of ECG beats including normal beat and seven arrhythmia\\nbeats. Optimized CNN model is designed with considering important concepts\\nsuch as data augmentation, regularization, and K -fold cross-validation. As a\\nresult, our proposed scheme achieved 0.989 AUC, 99.05% average accuracy,\\n99.57% speciﬁcity, 97.85% average sensitivity, and 98.55% average positive\\npredictive value. Our ECG arrhythmia classiﬁcation result indicates that de-\\ntection of arrhythmia with ECG images and CNN model can be an eﬀective\\napproach to help the experts to diagnose cardiovascular diseases which can be\\nseen from ECG signals. Furthermore, proposed ECG arrhythmia classiﬁcation\\nmethod can be applied to the medical robot or the scanner that can monitors\\nthe ECG signals and helps the medical experts to identify ECG arrhythmia\\nmore precisely and easily. For the future work, we are building an integrated\\nECG arrhythmia classiﬁcation system that scans the patient’s ECG monitor\\nthrough the camera of the medical robot and diagnose the arrhythmia to in-\\nform the physician. Proposed ECG arrhythmia classiﬁcation will be applied\\nthe ECG images obtained from the medical robot’s camera.\\nAcknowledgements This research was supported by International Research & Develop-\\nment Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) funded by the Ministry\\nof Science, ICT&Future Planning of Korea(2016K1A3A7A03952054) and support of Asan\\nMedical Center providing IVUS images and clinical advices for this research are gratefully\\nacknowledged.\\nReferences\\n1.

Traditionally, it is divided into two steps, including the step of feature extraction\\nand the step of pattern classiﬁcation. Owing to recent advances in artiﬁcial intelligence, it has been\\ndemonstrated that deep neural network, which trained on a huge amount of data, can carry out the task\\nof feature extraction directly from the data and recognize cardiac arrhythmias better than professional\\ncardiologists. This paper proposes an ECG arrhythmia classiﬁcation method using two-dimensional (2D)\\ndeep convolutional neural network (CNN). The time domain signals of ECG, belonging to ﬁve heart beat\\ntypes including normal beat (NOR), left bundle branch block beat (LBB), right bundle branch block beat\\n(RBB), premature ventricular contraction beat (PVC), and atrial premature contraction beat (APC), were\\nﬁrst transformed into time-frequency spectrograms by short-time Fourier transform. Subsequently, the\\nspectrograms of the ﬁve arrhythmia types were utilized as input to the 2D-CNN such that the ECG arrhythmia\\ntypes were identiﬁed and classiﬁed ﬁnally. Using ECG recordings from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database\\nas the training and testing data, the classiﬁcation results show that the proposed 2D-CNN model can reach an\\naveraged accuracy of 99.00%. On the other hand, in order to achieve optimal classiﬁcation performances, the\\nmodel parameter optimization was investigated. It was found when the learning rate is 0.001 and the batch\\nsize parameter is 2500, the classiﬁer achieved the highest accuracy and the lowest loss. We also compared\\nthe proposed 2D-CNN model with a conventional one-dimensional CNN model. Comparison results show\\nthat the 1D-CNN classiﬁer can achieve an averaged accuracy of 90.93%. Therefore, it is validated that the\\nproposed CNN classiﬁer using ECG spectrograms as input can achieve improved classiﬁcation accuracy\\nwithout additional manual pre-processing of the ECG signals.\\nINDEX TERMS Electrocardiogram (ECG); arrhythmia classiﬁcation; short-time Fourier transform (STFT);\\nconvolutional neural network; model parameter optimization.\\nI.

Huang et al.: ECG Arrhythmia Classification Using STFT-Based Spectrogram and CNN\\nsignals is a signiﬁcant task for the automatic diagnosis of\\ncardiovascular disease.\\nTraditionally, the classiﬁcation of ECG signals usually\\nneeds to be divided into two steps, i.e., feature extraction and\\npattern classiﬁcation. Studies on detection concentrate on the\\nproblem of determining heartbeat within the ECG data, and\\nsome technologies have been applied in heartbeat detection,\\nincluding threshold-based methods [2], digital ﬁlter-based\\nmethods [3], [4], and wavelet transform (WT) [5]–[7] and\\nso on. The pattern classiﬁcation of detected ECG signals\\nis another step. Wavelet transform is one of the commonly\\nused methods for obtaining the features of ECG signals.\\nLi used the wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) technique\\nto obtain representative features for the detection of ﬁve\\ndifferent heartbeat types, and calculate entropy from decom-\\nposed coefﬁcients with WPD [8]. Özbay computed detail\\nand approximation wavelet coefﬁcients of the ECG features\\nto generate feature vectors [9]. Li proposed a novel method\\nbased on genetic algorithm-back propagation neural network\\n(GA-BPNN) for classifying ECG signals with feature extrac-\\ntion using wavelet packet decomposition [10]. Other methods\\nwere also employed for extracting features from ECG signals.\\nElhaj extracted the linear and nonlinear features from the\\nsignals for automatic ECG beat recognition [11]. Y eh used a\\ncomplex ECG feature extraction technique to classify and dis-\\ntinguish differences between normal heartbeats and abnormal\\nheartbeats [12]. Alickovic proposed an autoregressive (AR)\\nmodel in the feature extraction module for diagnosing heart\\ndiseases [13].\\nAfter the step of feature extraction of ECG signals,\\nclassiﬁcation is traditionally conducted using state-of-the-art\\nclassiﬁers such as support vector machines (SVM), neural\\nnetworks (NN), cluster analysis (CA), random forests (RF),\\noptimum-path forest (OPF) and some other classiﬁcation\\ntools [14]. R.J. Martis automatically classiﬁed ﬁve types\\nof ECG beats using HOS features (higher order cumulants)\\nusing three layer feed-forward Neural Network (NN) and\\nLeast Square- Support V ector Machine (LS-SVM) classi-\\nﬁers [15]. V aratharajan.R presented a big data classiﬁcation\\napproach using LDA with an enhanced SVM method for ECG\\nsignals in cloud computing [16]. Y un-Chi Y eh proposed a\\nmethod of analyzing ECG signal to diagnose cardiac arrhyth-\\nmias utilizing the cluster analysis (CA) method, which could\\naccurately classify and distinguish the difference between\\nnormal heartbeats (NORM) and abnormal heartbeats [12].\\nTaiyong L proposed a method to classify ECG signals using\\nwavelet packet entropy (WPE) and random forests (RF)\\nfollowing the Association for the Advancement of Medi-\\ncal Instrumentation (AAMI) recommendations and the inter-\\npatient scheme [17]. VHC De Albuquerque introduced the\\nOptimum-Path Forest (OPF) classiﬁer to automatic arrhyth-\\nmia detection in ECG patterns [18]. In our approach ,we\\nhave used SVM (Support V ector Machine) for classiﬁcation\\npurpose.

P .Pławiak presentd\\nan innovative research methodology that enables the efﬁcient\\nclassiﬁcation of cardiac disorders (17 classes) based on ECG\\nsignal analysis and an evolutionary-neural system [20].\\nIn recent years, deep learning techniques have shown\\ntheir outstanding performances in pattern recognition appli-\\ncations [21]. Owing to this, researchers and engineers have\\nshifted their attentions on ECG classiﬁcation studies based on\\ndeep learning related techniques. Many scholars have made a\\nlarge amount of efforts on the study of ECG classiﬁcation\\nusing deep learning techniques. In the literature, it have\\nbeen reported that several methods are effective for ECG\\narrhythmia classiﬁcation. Salloum proposed the using of\\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs) to develop an effective\\nsolution to identiﬁcation and authentication in electrocar-\\ndiogram (ECG)-based biometrics [22]. Mostayed proposed a\\nrecurrent neural network which consists of two bi-directional\\nlong-short-term-memory layers to detect pathologies in\\n12-lead ECG signals [23]. Zhang proposed a novel\\npatient-speciﬁc electrocardiogram classiﬁcation algorithm\\nbased on the recurrent neural networks (RNN) to learn\\ntime correlation from ECG signal samples and to clas-\\nsify ECG beats with different heart rates [24]. Kiranyaz\\nproposed a real-time patient-speciﬁc ECG classiﬁcation\\napproach based on the 1D convolutional neural net-\\nworks, which can be solely used to classify long ECG\\nrecords of patients [25]. Li proposed a 1D-CNN based\\nmethod to realize the classiﬁcation of 5 typical types of\\narrhythmia signals, i.e., normal, left bundle branch block,\\nright bundle branch block, atrial premature contraction and\\nventricular premature contraction [26]. Yin proposed an ECG\\nmonitoring system integrated with the Impulse Radio Ultra\\nWideband (IR-UWB) radar based on CNN [27]. Jun proposed\\nan effective ECG arrhythmia classiﬁcation method using a\\ndeep two-dimensional convolutional neural network which\\nrecently shows outstanding performance in the ﬁeld of pattern\\nrecognition [28]. Salem proposed an ECG arrhythmia classi-\\nﬁcation method using transfer learning from 2D deep CNN\\nfeatures, and the method was applied in the identiﬁcation and\\nclassiﬁcation of four ECG patterns [29].\\nStudies mentioned above show that a deep neural net-\\nwork can automatically learn complex representative features\\ndirectly from the data adaptively so that we can reduce\\nexcessive dependencies on manual feature extractions, and\\ncreate end-to-end learning systems that take ECG signals\\nas input and arrhythmia class prediction as output, while\\nextracting the ‘‘deep features’’ automatically [29]. How-\\never, as compared to the traditional classiﬁcation approaches,\\nDNNs require a considerable amount of data as the training\\nset. This problem creates a gap between the dataset size and\\ndeep features, since the datasets that are publicly available in\\nthis domain lack in volume [30].\\nIn this paper, we propose an ECG arrhythmia classiﬁca-\\ntion method based on a deep two-dimensional convolutional\\nneural network on classiﬁcation of ﬁve different rhythms.\\nThe input one-dimensional ECG signals in the time domain\\nsignals are transformed into two-dimensional time-frequency\\n92872 VOLUME 7, 2019'),\n",

ECG DATA PRE-PROCESSING\\nWithin the proposed 2D-CNN, the input data is required\\nto be of the type of image. Therefore, the ECG signals in\\nthe time domain, which belong to ﬁve heart disease types,\\nwere ﬁrstly transformed into 2D time-frequency spectro-\\ngrams using short-time Fourier transform (STFT).\\nThe ECG signal is a nonstationary data which instanta-\\nneous frequency varies according to the time. Therefore,\\nthe properties of the changes cannot be fully described by\\nmerely using information in the frequency domain. The STFT\\nis an enhanced mathematical methodology, derived from the\\ndiscrete Fourier transform (DFT), to explore the instanta-\\nneous frequency as well as the instantaneous amplitude of\\nlocalized waves with time-varying characteristics.\\nIn the analysis of a non-stationary signal, it is assumed that\\nit is approximately stationary within the span of a temporal\\nwindow of ﬁnite support [32]. For a discretized digital signal,\\nits time-frequency spectrogram is given as\\nSTFT{x[n]}= X (m,ω )=\\n∞∑\\nn=−∞\\nx[n]w[n− m]e−jωn (1)\\nwhere x[n] represents the ECG signal which sampling rate\\nwas 360 Hz, andw[n] is the window function.

CNN was ﬁrst introduced by LeCun [33] and was devel-\\noped through a project to recognize handwritten zip codes.\\nWith the advent of the CNN model, correlation of spatially\\nadjacent pixels can be extracted by applying a nonlinear ﬁlter\\nand by applying multiple ﬁlters, and it is capable of extracting\\nvarious local features of the image.\\n2D convolutional and pooling layers are more suitable for\\nﬁltering the spatial locality of ECG images [28].

EVALUATION METRICS\\nIn this section, we attempt to evaluate the classiﬁcation per-\\nformance using two metrics, e.g., the accuracy and the loss.\\nThe indicator of the accuracy is the ratio between the\\nnumber of correctly classiﬁed samples and that of the whole\\ntest samples. Its mathematical expression is deﬁned as\\nAccuracy(%)= TP+ TN\\nTP+ TN+ FP+ FN× 100, (3)\\nwhere TP stands for true positive, meaning the correct classi-\\nﬁcation as arrhythmia; TN stands for true negative, meaning\\ncorrect classiﬁcation as normal; FP stands for false posi-\\ntive, meaning incorrect classiﬁcation as arrhythmia; FN rep-\\nresents false negative, meaning incorrect classiﬁcation as\\nnormal [27].\\nAs for the metric of loss, it is deﬁned as the difference\\nbetween the predicted value of the model and the true value\\nfor a speciﬁc sample. This metric has several distinct types\\nof mathematical expressions. In this study, we choose the\\nfunction of categorical cross entropy loss.\\nloss=− 1\\nn\\nn∑\\ni=1\\nˆyi1 ln yi1+ˆyi2 ln yi2+... +ˆyim ln yim, (4)\\nwhere n represents the number of samples; m represents the\\nnumber of categories;ˆy represents the predictive output value;\\nand y represents the actual value.\\nB. MODEL PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION\\nIn this proposed 2D-CNN model, there are two main param-\\neters, that is, the learning rate and the batch size. In order\\nto achieve the best classiﬁcation performance of ECG heart\\nrhythm abnormalities, the step of model parameter optimiza-\\ntion is indispensable.\\nTo evaluate the importance of the learning rate and the\\nbatch size within the proposed 2D-CNN model, a series\\nof contrast experiments with different parameter sets were\\nconducted. On one hand, we tested the contrast experiments\\nwith different learning rates when keeping the value of the\\nbatch size unchanged. The detailed parameter set is shown\\nin Table 3. On the other hand, we attempted the contrast\\nexperiments with different batch sizes when keeping the value\\nof the learning rate unchanged.

Huang et al.: ECG Arrhythmia Classification Using STFT-Based Spectrogram and CNN\\nIn summary, the proposed method is a simple and efﬁcient\\nmethod with high classiﬁcation accuracy.\\nThe confusion matrix for the ﬁnal result in the proposed\\n2D-CNN classiﬁer is shown in Fig. 11.\\nIV. CONCLUSION\\nIn this paper, we proposed an ECG arrhythmia classiﬁ-\\ncation method based on deep learning techniques. ECG\\nsignals, belonging to ﬁve different types, were obtained\\nfrom the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The ECG signals\\nwere segmented into records of the duration of 10 seconds.\\n2520 records were selected for ECG classiﬁcation.\\nIn the procedure of the proposed method, the ECG signals\\nin the time domain were transformed into two-dimensional\\ntime-frequency ECG spectrograms by short-time Fourier\\ntransform. The resultant ECG spectrograms were used as\\ninput to the proposed method. The ECG arrhythmia was\\nidentiﬁed and classiﬁed using the CNN. The results show that\\nthe classiﬁcation of ECG signals based on two-dimensional\\nconvolution neural network can reach an averaged accuracy\\nof 99.00%.\\nIn addition, in order to achieve the best classiﬁcation\\nperformance, a series of contrast experiments with different\\nparameter sets were made. We found that the classiﬁer based\\non the proposed 2D-CNN model has the highest accuracy and\\nthe lowest loss when the learning rate is 0.001 and the batch\\nsize is 2500.\\nFinally, we compared the performance of the proposed\\n2D-CNN model with that of the 1D-CNN model. ECG\\nrecordings of ﬁve arrhythmia types, shared by the MIT-BIH\\narrhythmia database, were utilized for evaluations of the\\nclassiﬁcation performance. As a result, the 2D-CNN clas-\\nsiﬁer achieved an averaged accuracy of 99.00%, while the\\n1D-CNN classiﬁer achieved an averaged accuracy of 90.93%.\\nThe ECG arrhythmia classiﬁcation experimental results have\\nsuccessfully validated that the proposed 2D-CNN can achieve\\nbetter classiﬁcation accuracy without manual pre-processing\\nof the ECG signals such as noise ﬁltering, feature extraction,\\nand feature reduction.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] World Health.

It is mainly used for the diagnosis\\nof ischemic heart disease/coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction (heart\\nattack), arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms), and cardiomyopathy (heart muscle\\ndisease). Given that arrhythmia is precipitated by malfunctions in the heart’ s electrical\\nsystem, the ECG provides a directand non-invasive mechanism to examine these\\nconditions ( Sun\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2021 ).

Moreover, ECG\\nmachines, like Holter monitors, are cost-effective and standard\\napparatuses in medical establishments, thus ensuring their wide\\navailability. These devices offer swift, exhaustive data concerning\\nthe heart, encompassing aspects such as heart rate, rhythm,\\nand evidence of possible pathologies. Established interpretative\\nguidelines for ECG traces contribute to the identification of\\nspecific markers for diverse arrhythmia types ( Aljohani, 2022 ).\\nFurthermore, the characteristics of ECG signals, coupled with\\nthe substantial volume of ECG data obtainable, make them well\\nsuited for application and analysis via machine learning (ML)\\nmethodologies.\\nDespite the valuable role that ECG plays in arrhythmia detection\\nand classification, the analysis of ECG faces several challenges. A\\ntraditional electrocardiographic analysis is often labor-intensive and\\ndependent on the expertise of skilled clinicians, which may lead\\nto interpretative discrepancies (Halford, 2009). Moreover, standard\\nECG machines may not capture sporadic or transient arrhythmias\\nif they do not occur during recording, presenting a significant\\ndrawback in their sensitivity. Furthermore, the requirement for\\nphysical contact points (electrodes) and their placement could also\\naffect the accuracy of the recordings while potentially causing\\ndiscomfort to patients over extended periods. Accessibility in remote\\nareas or resource-limited settings may also pose challenges due to\\nthe cost of equipment and the need for trained healthcare providers.\\nAdditionally, ECG signals are susceptible to noise and artifacts, such\\nas powerline interference, muscle activity, electrode contact issues,\\nand motion artifacts, distorting the waveform and affecting analysis\\naccuracy. The noise contamination necessitates advanced signal\\nprocessing techniques for reliable interpretation. Consequently,\\ndespite a negative ECG result, additional investigations may be\\nwarranted for a thorough medical evaluation of the patient’ s possible\\nconditions.\\nThis sets the stage for developing and integrating automated,\\nlow-cost systems employing deep learning (DL) and machine\\nlearning models ( Akkus\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2019 ). Such systems offer the\\npotential for continuous, real-time monitoring and more accurate\\ninterpretation of ECG signals, thereby increasing the likelihood of\\ncapturing intermittent arrhythmias. The use of ML and DL models\\nin ECG interpretation could also standardize analyses, reducing\\nthe variability inherent in human interpretation and potentially\\nleading to improved patient outcomes ( Ansari\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2023b). Thus,\\nit is essential to foster research and development in the promising\\nfield of ML to realize its potential benefits fully.\\nDL methods have delivered promising results for a variety\\nof applications, including computer vision ( Wu\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2017 ;\\nAnsari\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2023a ), speech recognition ( Deng and Platt, 2014 ),\\nsignal analysis ( Gao\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2021 ), classification, image, and pixel\\nanalysis (Hausen and Robertson, 2020 ; Ansari\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2022c; Ansari\\nand Qaraqe, 2023 ), risk analysis ( Akhtar\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2021 ; Ansari\\xa0et\\xa0al.,\\n2022b) and natural language processing (Bengio and LeCun, 2007).\\nMost ECG interpretation algorithms employ DL methodologies,\\nleveraging their inherent abilities to extract and process the\\ninformation in ECG time series for improved detection and\\naccurate classification. Some DL methodologies remove the need\\nfor manual feature selection and extraction, offering automatic\\nfeature selection and superior performance ( Chandrasekar\\xa0et\\xa0al.,\\n2023). Advancements in DL techniques and ease of availability\\nof systems with higher computational capacity have catalyzed\\nsignificant progress in arrhythmia detection and classification. This\\nprogress is fueled by DL ’ s inherent abilities to capture and interpret\\ntemporal variations in ECG signals. This property allows DL models\\nto understand the different types of arrhythmias ( Chu\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2023).\\nProminent DL algorithms like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),\\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Transformers\\npossess the ability to understand both short-term patterns within\\nindividual heartbeats and long-term irregularities spanning multiple\\nheartbeats ( Attia\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2019 ). This property allows the detection\\nof conditions like Premature V entricular Contraction (PVC) and\\nAtrial Fibrillation (AF), which depend on single heartbeats and\\nmay require pattern identification across multiple heartbeats (Khan\\nand Kim, 2021 ). In cases wherein variations are required to be\\nobserved in a specific beat, like in the conditions of Premature\\nAtrial or V entricular Contractions, DL offers dynamic classifiers\\nthat can preserve long-term memory, which is key in solving\\nsuch classification problems. Conversely, dynamic classifiers can\\nalso preserve short-term memory, which allows them to address\\nconditions of Ectopic Beats characterized by deflection of the P-\\nwave from its usual sinusoidal form ( Mathur\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2020). Overall,\\nDL exhibits inherent properties that make it ideal for rapid\\nlearning and subsequent classification of cardiac arrhythmia and its\\ntypes.\\nPrevious literature such as Bizopoulos and Koutsouris (2018) ,\\nDewangan and Shukla (2015) , Dinakarrao\\xa0et\\xa0al. (2019) , and\\nLuz\\xa0et\\xa0al. (2016) have offered an overview of detection and\\nclassification methods for arrhythmia up to the year 2019.\\nHowever, we identified a conspicuous void of comprehensive\\nsurveys enveloping the recent years, with only a few works\\nlike ( Parvaneh\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2019 ; T eplitzky\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2020 ; Xiao\\xa0et\\xa0al.,\\n2023a) not considering studies past the year 2022. These\\ninvestigations have surveyed existing literature but need to\\nimprove their provision of in-depth comparative chronological\\nanalyses. T o the best of our knowledge, no tutorial is tailored\\nexplicitly for novice researchers, enabling them to assimilate the\\ncurrent research trends in this domain quickly. This shortage\\nhas highlighted the need to focus on the highest-performing\\nstudies rather than indiscriminately collecting all existing\\nworks.\\nFor instance ( Koppad, 2021 ), analyzes 25 papers published\\nfrom 2016 to 2020, primarily leveraging Convolutional Neural\\nNetworks in their summary and mainly using the MIT-BIH\\ndatabase. However, this work is not sufficiently comprehensive.\\nSimilarly ( Hong\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2020 ), reviews 191 papers, predominantly\\npublished before 2019, exploring a variety of DL architectures for\\nECG analytics tasks, yet it needs in-depth comparative analysis.\\nThese papers need more intertextual analysis to guide novice\\nreaders.\\nReviews by (Ebrahimi\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2020; Hammad\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2021) present\\ndetailed analyses of papers published within specific short periods\\n(2017–2018).

Deep\\nlearning methods use artificial neural networks with multiple layers\\nto learn hierarchical representations of data. They are instrumental\\nin ECG analysis because they excel at extracting complicated\\nfeatures from raw input data. Researchers have made considerable\\nadvances in the accuracy of arrhythmia detection and classification\\ntasks by applying DL ( Parvaneh\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2019 ). In this section, we\\ndiscuss fundamental DL techniques like the feedforward Multilayer\\nPerceptron (MLP), the locally receptive Convolutional Neural\\nNetwork (CNN), the sequence-aware Recurrent Neural Network\\n(RNN), the memory-adept Long Short-T erm Memory (LSTM), the\\nsimplified and efficient Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), the generative\\nDeep Belief Network (DBN), and the attention-based Transformer\\nthat have proven to produce excellent results to analyze ECG\\ndata. This choice of these various strategies can be explained by\\nthe distinct advantages that each one of them has in terms of\\nrecording specific ECG signal pattern characteristics. W e have\\nselected these methods because of their diverse strengths in handling\\nvarious types of data and learning challenges, which provide a\\ncomplete perspective of the potential of deep learning approaches\\nin ECG interpretation.

The input segment of the MLP is intended to be\\ncategorized into one of the specified arrhythmia classes by the\\noutput layer of the MLP ( Özbay\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2006 ). MLP models learn\\nto generalize and effectively categorize unknown ECG segments\\nby being trained on a labeled dataset of ECG segments with their\\ncorresponding arrhythmia categories, making them a valuable tool\\nfor arrhythmia detection and classification in clinical situations.\\nMLPs’ drawback is that they do not take into account the temporal\\nconnections between input data, which can be significant in the\\nsetting of ECG signals, where repeating patterns can signify certain\\narrhythmias.\\n3.2 Convolutional neural network (CNN)\\nA Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a class of\\nartificial neural networks primarily used for signal analysis, image\\nrecognition, pixel data, and natural language processing. They are fit\\nat identifying spatial hierarchies or patterns using stacked trainable\\nsmall filters called kernels ( Hong\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2020 ). These kernels may\\neffectively extract local information from the context of ECG\\ndata, such as the shape and duration of heartbeats, which are\\nessential for diagnosing arrhythmias. When working with raw ECG\\ndata, one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs)\\napply kernels along the temporal dimension ( Nurmaini\\xa0et\\xa0al.,\\n2020b), whereas two-dimensional convolutional neural networks\\n(2D CNNs) deal with ECG data transformed into images and\\nother two-dimensional formats ( Ansari\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2021 ). Examples\\nof such transformations include distance distribution matrices\\nthat are derived from entropy computations ( Gabrié\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2018 )\\nas well as gray-level co-occurrence matrices ( De\\xa0Siqueira\\xa0et\\xa0al.,\\n2013) and beat-to-beat correlations ( W en\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2019 ). When\\napplied to ECG signal analysis, CNNs automatically learn and\\nextract relevant features from raw ECG signals, improving the\\naccuracy of arrhythmia detection. By recognizing characteristic\\nwave patterns, CNNs can differentiate between normal and\\nabnormal heart rhythms. However, because CNNs have a fixed\\nreceptive field size, they might have difficulties processing lengthy\\nsequences. As a result, they might overlook long-term dependencies\\nin the information, which are crucial for understanding ECG\\nsignals.\\n3.3 Recurrent neural network (RNN)\\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) stand for another class\\nof artificial neural networks equipped with feedback mechanisms\\nthat are fit to capture temporal correlations from time series data.\\nRNNs are equipped with cyclic connections, which sets them apart\\nfrom conventional feedforward neural networks. Because of their\\ncapacity to store temporal information, RNNs are exceptionally\\nwell suited for ECG analysis, where the sequential nature of\\ncardiac rhythms is essential for spotting anomalies. This structure\\nallows them to retain information across time, making them\\nappropriate for ECG data processing ( Khan and Kim, 2021 ).\\nThe raw ECG signal must first undergo preprocessing to remove\\nnoise and undesirable artifacts before identifying and categorizing\\narrhythmias. The cleaned ECG data is then divided into equal-\\nsized segments, each corresponding to a heartbeat or a specific time\\nlength. These segments are then supplied into the RNN as sequential\\ninput vectors, allowing the network to understand the ECG data’ s\\nunderlying temporal dynamics. The RNN recognizes and extracts\\npertinent characteristics from the ECG data as it navigates through\\nthe sequence. It uses the learned features to identify and classify\\narrhythmias ( Zhou\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2018 ). However, a typical problem with\\nRNNs is the vanishing gradient problem, which makes it challenging\\nto train them to understand long-term dependencies. This problem\\ncould hinder their ability to deal with lengthy ECG segments or\\nintricate sequential patterns. As a result, the intrinsic capacity of\\nRNNs to analyze sequential data paves the way for more accurate\\nand robust systems for arrhythmia detection and classification,\\nthereby playing a pivotal role in the detection and treatment of\\ncardiovascular diseases.\\n3.4 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\\nLong Short-T erm Memory Networks (LSTMs) are a form of\\nRNNs designed to recall data over extended periods, making them\\nideal for sequential data ( Zhou\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2018). LSTMs present unique\\ncharacteristics, such as memory cells that retain information and\\ngates that govern the flow of information into and out of these\\ncells. These gates allow LSTMs to learn and retain longer sequences,\\nwhich is crucial when working with ECG data that exhibit significant\\nproperties over long time scales. These features help overcome\\nthe vanishing gradient problem common in standard RNNs. This\\nfeature of LSTMs makes them particularly useful for problems\\ninvolving learning from temporal data sequences, such as ECG\\nsignals ( Khan and Kim, 2021 ). By converting the ECG signal into\\nsequential data segments, ECG data may be fed into an LSTM\\nfor arrhythmia detection and classification. Each segment depicts\\na sequence of electrical cardiac activities collected over a specific\\nperiod. The time-series data, which consists of sequential cardiac\\ncycles, is fed into the LSTM so that the interdependencies between\\nthese heartbeats may be learned and modeled. Based on this learned\\nknowledge, the LSTM can identify and categorize arrhythmia\\npatterns, making it a valuable tool for the automated detection of\\nECG cardiac arrhythmias. However, LSTMs are computationally\\nmore expensive than more straightforward models like RNNs\\nor MLPs despite having more sophisticated features. It can be\\nchallenging to meet this increased processing requirement, mainly\\nwhen working with big ECG datasets. Compared to conventional\\napproaches, LSTMs’ unique capacity to analyze and learn from\\nsequential data enables more precise and efficient identification and\\ncategorization of arrhythmia.\\n3.5 Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\\nGated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are a type of RNN and were\\ncreated to mitigate the vanishing gradient of standard RNNs.\\nThis feature helped to improve their capacity to capture long-\\nterm relationships in data.

This makes GRUs ideal\\nfor tasks that require sequential data processing and long-term\\ndependency modeling, such as ECG signal analysis. ECG data may\\nbe divided into several time-sequenced data blocks for detecting\\nand categorizing arrhythmias, each representing a sequence of\\nelectrical cardiac activity during a specific period. The GRU\\nreceives this time-series data, which is made up of sequential\\nheartbeats. The GRU learns and models the temporal connections\\nbetween these sequential heartbeats, permitting the detection and\\ncategorization of arrhythmic patterns based on the learned temporal\\nfeatures (Murat\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2020). GRUs, like LSTMs, are computationally\\nintensive, which can make them difficult to use with massive\\nECG datasets. By utilizing GRUs’ unique capacity to analyze and\\ninterpret sequential data, it is feasible to obtain more accurate\\nand efficient detection and categorization of cardiac arrhythmias,\\nimproving prediction performance compared to previous\\napproaches.\\n3.6 Deep Belief Network (DBN)\\nDeep Belief Networks (DBNs) are a class of deep neural\\nnetworks comprising several layers of latent variables or ‘hidden\\nunits’ with connections only permissible between layers, not\\nwithin levels ( Sarikaya\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2014 ). DBNs are typically made\\nup of stacks of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) or\\nautoencoders, in which the hidden variables of each layer serve\\nas the visible variables for the following layer. DBNs may help\\ndevelop robust, discriminative models by discovering complex\\npatterns inside datasets using the probabilistic model, which enables\\nthem to generate top-down models. They are, therefore, appropriate\\nfor applications requiring high-level data abstraction, such as\\nidentifying arrhythmia-indicating hidden patterns in ECG signals.\\nDBNs may learn to represent ECG data in a way that captures the\\nsignificant patterns or characteristics in the data, which assists in\\nidentifying irregular heartbeats and arrhythmias ( Taji\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2017).\\nThe drawback of DBNs is that they, like other deep learning models,\\nneed a lot of labeled data for training, which can be difficult given\\nthe lack of labeled ECG datasets.\\n3.7 Transformers\\nTransformers stand for an effective deep learning model\\narchitecture that was first presented for natural language processing\\napplications and has since shown promise in several other\\nfields (Hu\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2022). They employ self-attention mechanisms to\\ncapture long-term dependencies and background information more\\nsuccessfully. Transformers equipped with attention mechanisms\\nmay be used to learn complicated patterns and connections within\\ntime-series data to identify and categorize arrhythmias in ECG\\ndata (Y an\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2019). By modeling each ECG signal as a sequence\\nof data points, the transformer model can interpret the input\\nsignal by responding to critical aspects and capturing temporal\\nrelationships over the whole sequence. This property allows the\\nmodel to assess both local and global patterns at the same time.\\nTransformers are less simple to use because they require much\\ncomputation and may need different hyperparameters, like attention\\nheads and model sizes, to adjust. The transformer model uses\\nits ability to evaluate and understand sequential data for more\\nprecise and efficient identification and categorization of cardiac\\narrhythmias.\\n4 Medical background\\n4.1 Arrhythmia\\nArrhythmia refers to the condition of having an irregularity\\nor anomaly in the rhythm of the heartbeat. The normal heartbeat\\nfollows a pattern known as sinus rhythm, in which electrical\\nsignals are generated by the sinoatrial (SA) node in the heart’ s\\nright atrium. These signals go through specialized routes known\\nas the conduction system and coordinate the contraction of\\nthe heart’ s chambers, resulting in a regular and synchronized\\nbeating ( Antzelevitch and Burashnikov, 2011 ). However, various\\nfactors can disturb the regular heart-beating rhythms and lead\\nto arrhythmias. Arrhythmias are categorized into numerous kinds\\naccording to their origin, mechanism, and characteristics. The\\ntwo broad categories are tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias.\\nTachyarrhythmias are aberrant cardiac rhythms characterized by a\\nrapid heartbeat, whereas bradyarrhythmias manifest through a slow\\nheartbeat.\\n• Tachyarrhythmias is divided into supraventricular and\\nventricular tachyarrhythmias.\\n• Supraventricular Tachyarrhythmias include Atrial\\nFibrillation (AF), Atrial Flutter, and Paroxysmal\\nSupraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT). The most common\\npersistent tachyarrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, is caused\\nby disordered electrical impulses in the atria, resulting\\nin irregular and typically fast heartbeats. Atrial flutter is\\nidentified by frequent, fast atrial contractions, as shown by\\na sawtooth-shaped waveform on the ECG. PSVT manifests\\nas intermittent episodes of rapid heart rate stemming from\\nabnormal electrical pathways or re-entry circuits in the atria\\nor atrioventricular (A V) node.\\n• Ventricular Tachyarrhythmias include ventricular\\ntachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). VT is\\ncharacterized by a fast cardiac rhythm that originates in\\nthe ventricles and often exceeds 100 beats per minute.\\nIt happens when aberrant electrical impulses cause the\\nventricles to contract quicker. VF is a potentially fatal\\narrhythmia that causes disorganized and chaotic electrical\\nactivity inside the ventricles. If immediate care is not\\ninitiated, VF limits efficient blood pumping and can result\\nin cardiac arrest.\\n• Bradyarrhythmias are typically caused by the conditions of\\nSinus Node Dysfunction or Atrioventricular (A V) conduction.\\n• Sinus Node Dysfunction refers to a slow heart rhythm at\\na rate lesser than average (generally less than 60 beats per\\nminute). It occurs due to abnormal electrical activity in\\nthe Sinoatrial (SA) Node, which is responsible for starting\\nelectrical signals in the heart.\\n• Atrioventricular (AV) Conduction Disorders are due to\\nanomalies in the passage of electrical impulses between the\\nFrontiers in Physiology 06 frontiersin.org'),\n",

These disorders are of three types: first-\\ndegree A V block, second-degree A V block, and third-degree\\nA V block. The second-degree A V block presents Type I\\nand Type II subclasses, and the third-degree A V usually\\nindicates the total heart block. First-degree A V block is\\ncharacterized by a delay in electrical conduction, resulting\\nin a longer ECG PR interval. Second-degree A V block\\nis defined as intermittent or partial electrical conduction\\nfailure, with Type I characterized by a gradual lengthening\\nof PR intervals until a dropped beat occurs. Type II second-\\ndegree A V block is characterized by intermittent non-\\nconducted atrial beats without gradual PR prolongation.\\nThird-degree A V block is characterized by a total electrical\\nsignal blockage between the atria and ventricles, frequently\\nnecessitating pacemaker installation for optimal heart rate\\ncontrol.\\nElectrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is one of the benchmark\\napproaches for detecting arrhythmia. An ECG analyzes the heart’ s\\nelectrical activity and converts it into line tracings on paper called\\nwaves (T eich\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2000). An ECG scan depends on the placement\\nof electrodes, which are small plastic patches that stick to the\\nskin on certain spots on the patient’ s chest, arms, and legs. These\\nelectrodes record the electrical signals of the patient’ s heart and\\nsend them to a machine that maps the signals as waves for medical\\ndiagnosis.\\n4.2 Readings of ECG\\nThe ECG trace is made up of five major components, each\\nof which provides crucial information for the diagnosis of heart\\ndisorders ( T eich\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2000 ). Figure\\xa02 shows a labeled visual\\nschematic of a standard ECG signal. The following are the five\\ncomponents of an ECG trace.\\n• P wave represents the atria’ s depolarization and subsequent\\ncontraction. It depicts the propagation of electrical impulses\\nacross the atrial myocardium, which results in atrial contraction\\nand the initiation of ventricular filling. Conditions including\\natrial enlargement, conduction problems, or atrial arrhythmias\\nmay be indicated by P waveform, duration, or amplitude\\nanomalies.\\n• QRS complex comprises three different graphical deflections:\\nQ, R, and S. It reflects the depolarization and subsequent\\ncontraction of the ventricles. The QRS complex reflects\\nelectrical signal transmission through the ventricular\\nmyocardium, resulting in the violent ejection of blood\\nfrom the ventricles. Deviations in the duration, amplitude,\\nor shape of the QRS complex may indicate ventricular\\nhypertrophy, bundle branch blockages, or ventricular\\narrhythmias.\\n• T wave represents the ventricle’ s repolarization or recovery\\nphase. It symbolizes the ventricular myocardium being\\nreturned to its resting condition. T wave shape, amplitude,\\nor duration changes may suggest various cardiac problems,\\nsuch as myocardial ischemia, electrolyte imbalances, or drug\\neffects.\\n• U wave is an extra wave that is seen following the T\\nwave in some instances. It is thought to signify additional\\nventricular recovery. Its clear physiological relevance and\\nclinical ramifications are currently being researched.\\n• PR interval denotes the time an electrical wave takes to travel\\nfrom the atria to the A V node and then to the ventricles. It\\nrepresents the time necessary to initiate atrial depolarization,\\natrioventricular conduction, and ventricular depolarization.\\nProlonged PR intervals might indicate A V conduction delays or\\nA V blocks.\\n• QT interval represents the entire duration required for\\nventricular depolarization and repolarization. It denotes the\\nduration of ventricular systole. QT interval abnormalities,\\nparticularly QT prolongation, may predispose people to\\npotentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias.\\n• ST segment stands for the time elapsed between depolarization\\nand repolarization of ventricles. It connects the T wave and the\\nQRS Complex. Changes in the ST segment, such as elevation\\nor depression, might provide important information about\\nmyocardial ischemia or damage.\\nA thorough comprehension of these components, intervals,\\nand segments is required to interpret ECG results accurately.\\nAnalyzing their properties, variations, and correlations helps to\\ndiagnose various heart diseases and guides proper management and\\ntreatment techniques. Arrhythmias can be asymptomatic or severe,\\ncausing palpitations, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, and\\npossibly loss of consciousness ( Abbott, 2005 ). Arrhythmias are\\nfrequently diagnosed and classified by examining ECG records,\\nwhich give vital information on the heart’ s electrical activity.\\nDepending on the nature and degree of the arrhythmia, treatment\\noptions may include medication, electrical cardioversion, catheter\\nablation, or implanted devices such as pacemakers or implantable\\ncardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). A thorough examination and\\nprecise categorization of arrhythmias are required to develop\\nsuitable treatment strategies and provide optimal patient care.\\n5 Datasets\\nThis section covers the ECG datasets commonly used in deep-\\nlearning models to detect cardiovascular diseases. These datasets\\nconsist of ECG signals collected from patients and are annotated\\nwith the corresponding cardiac events and conditions. These\\ndatasets have played a crucial role in developing DL algorithms\\nfor ECG signal processing, leading to notable advancements in\\ncardiovascular disease detection.\\n5.1 Creighton university ventricular\\ntachyarrhythmia database (CUDB)\\nThe CUDB dataset includes 35 short-term ECG recordings of\\npatients with sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular flutter,\\nand ventricular fibrillation.

They provide a balanced evaluation\\nthat accounts for overall performance and the accuracy of class\\nidentification, ensuring that the model performs well across all\\ncategories and does not overlook any one category.\\nThe DL models proposed for ECG signal classification have\\nadopted different pathways, each with distinctive features and\\nlimitations. Several approaches rely on the notion of patient-\\nspecific models for improved accuracy ( Luo\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2017 ). employs\\nan automatic feature abstraction and a deep neural network\\nclassifier to detect and classify arrhythmia. However, their approach\\nrequires extensive computation and other individually annotated\\nbeats as inputs ( Zhang\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2017 ). shares this limitation and\\nproposes a model based on RNNs and a density-based clustering\\ntechnique limited by the unbalanced classes in the dataset.\\nOn the other hand ( Majumdar and W ard, 2017 ), proposed a\\nmethod called robust deep dictionary learning, and Xia et\\xa0al.\\n(Xia\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2017) adopted the stationary wavelet transform for ECG\\npreprocessing to fit the requirements of deep convolution neural\\nnetworks. These methods, however, are challenged by the long\\nfeature extraction time and dependency on the accuracy of peak\\ndetection.\\nInnovative implementations such as the use of ECG images\\nfor classification ( Jun\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2018 ), bidirectional LSTM networks\\n(Yildirim, 2018), and hybrid combinations of RNNs and CNNs (Lui\\nand Chow, 2018 ) have also delivered promising results. However,\\nthese innovative methods need help integrating their technologies\\ninto a comprehensive system, dealing with the time cost of the\\ntraining phase and possible overfitting due to small sample sizes\\nrestrained by their choice of dataset.\\nMeanwhile ( Nguyen\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2018 ), focuses on Software\\nComposition Analysis (SCA) detection using a CNN for feature\\nextraction and a boosting classifier. In contrast ( Sannino\\nand De\\xa0Pietro, 2018 ), propose a Deep Neural Network for\\nabnormal ECG beat classification.

The future\\nprospects for wearable ECG learning involve addressing these\\nchallenges and further optimizing the technology for real-time,\\nefficient, and precise disease warning.\\nAn active deep learning-based classification method is proposed\\nby (Hanbay, 2019). This work determines six statistical features for\\neach heartbeat and combines them with the eigenvalues of ECG\\nbeats. Despite the novelty, a notable drawback is the time-consuming\\nfeature learning phase and the effect of temporal waveform patterns\\non feature extraction.\\nSimilar research on ECG classification was carried out by\\n(Chen\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2020 ), where the authors integrated CNN and LSTM\\nmodels to identify six types of ECG signals. The increased diversity\\nof subjects in the training data helped to achieve a high accuracy rate.\\nNevertheless, their approach requires QRS detection, adding to the\\ncomputational cost, and utilizes an imbalanced dataset, which led to\\nlow classification accuracy for the atrial flutter (AFL) category.\\nOn a different perspective (W ang and Zhou, 2019; Sharma\\xa0et\\xa0al.,\\n2021), focused on healthcare applications and heartbeat\\nabnormalities, respectively (W ang and Zhou, 2019). used short-term\\nHRV in conjunction with mobile devices for monitoring patients’\\nhealth but acknowledged the need to address data imbalance issues\\nin future work. Meanwhile ( Sharma\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2021 ), proposed an\\nefficient hybrid approach for classifying ECG samples into crucial\\narrhythmia classes, suggesting that their work could be extended to\\ncover more arrhythmia classes in the future.\\nSeveral other works have sought to improve ECG signal\\nclassification using sophisticated models. For instance ( Ojha\\xa0et\\xa0al.,\\n2022), implemented a 1D-CNN model based on an Auto-encoder\\nConvolution Network (ACN). Similarly ( Sepahvand and Abdali-\\nMohammadi, 2022), utilized knowledge distillation for arrhythmia\\nclassification. Implementing distillation models in this field is novel\\nand shows promise. However, in this work, the choice of the CNN\\nmodel and hyperparameters may not be optimal.\\nA recent study by ( Midani\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2023 ) suggests a novel\\nmethodological approach that combines feed-forward and recurrent\\ndeep neural networks using a sequential fusion method. This\\napproach aims to better represent relevant features of arrhythmia\\nin ECG signals. However, their method relied on a small\\ndatabase for training and testing and used R peak segmentation\\nbased on dataset annotation ( Kumar\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2023 ). puts forward a\\ntechnique called Fuzz-ClustNet, which combines deep learning and\\nfuzzy clustering for detecting arrhythmia. This method relies on\\ndenoising, augmentation, and segmentation.\\nDespite the promising results, these studies face numerous\\nlimitations and challenges, including the need for extra individually\\nannotated beats, class unbalances, long feature extraction time,\\nunder-representation of specific ECG beat types, limited access to\\nrich databases, the time cost of the training phase, dependence\\non the accuracy of peak detection, and issues with unnecessary\\ndefibrillation.

Research has\\nexplored various methods for detecting arrhythmia, including\\nFuzz-ClustNet, fuzzy clustering, and a deep learning framework\\n(Kumar\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2023 ). One approach, called ‘DeepArr, ’ combines\\nfeed-forward and recurrent neural networks to improve accuracy\\n(Midani\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2023 ). Both methods, however, are bound by\\ncertain limitations. While Fuzz-ClustNet could benefit from more\\nsophisticated signal processing methods, DeepArr’ s reliance on the\\nsmall MIT-BIH arrhythmia database for training and testing reduces\\nits generalizability.\\nThese limitations resonate with the issues encountered in other\\nstudies, such as the works of ( Kim\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2022 ; Sepahvand and\\nAbdali-Mohammadi, 2022 ), which leverage advanced DL models\\nfor ECG classification but admit potential shortcomings in their\\ndesign, specifically in the optimal selection of layers, filters, and\\nhyperparameters in the former and the generalization capability of\\nthe latter.\\nA similar narrative is carried forward in the studies of\\n(Hong\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2022; Zahid\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2022). Zahid et\\xa0al. introduced a 1D\\nSelf-Organizing Neural Network (ONN) for ECG classification.\\nThe goal is to learn morphological representations from ECG\\ndata automatically, but the authors also recognize the possibility\\nof enhancing the model’ s complexity. Hong et\\xa0al.‘s clinical ECG\\ninterpreter, in the meantime, grapples with the issue of ECG data\\nacquisition and heterogeneous data formats, a problem akin to the\\nlack of benchmark datasets lamented by ( Islam\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2022) in their\\nRNN-based arrhythmia classification study.\\nWhile (Ullah\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2020; Peimankar and Puthusserypady, 2021)\\nhave successfully proposed DL models that eliminate the feature\\nengineering step and extend ECG classification to more classes,\\nthey also echo the recurring theme of ECG waveform delineation\\nchallenges and the necessity of a more extensive and more diverse\\ndataset. This sentiment of data insufficiency extends to DeepArrNet\\n(Mahmud\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2020 ) and multitier DNN ( Hammad\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2020),\\nwith the latter indicating the method’ s susceptibility to noisy signals\\nand data-intensiveness.\\nIntertextual analysis of the gathered literature provides pivotal\\ninsights into current research trajectories and their respective\\nconstraints. Established works indicate that the limitations imposed\\nby the lack of size and diversity in the databases surpass those\\ndictated by the choice of learning algorithm ( T orralba and Efros,\\n2011). The need for more extensive and more balanced datasets\\nand efficient, less time-consuming models resonates across the\\nresearch landscape. Examining the key themes emerging from the\\nliterature underscores the critical role of data quality, the utilization\\nof public ECG databases, and the issue of data imbalance in ECG\\ndatabases.\\nFirst, data quality is critical for attaining excellent classification\\nperformance, as deep learning models rely primarily on\\nrobust and diverse training data. Access to various ECG data,\\nincluding all genders, ages, and health problems, is essential.\\nThe dependence on public ECG datasets, although necessary at\\npresent, has several limitations, with the need for more diverse\\ndata samples being apparent for improving the models’ clinical\\napplicability.\\nSecond, while the MITDB database serves as a comparison\\nbaseline for new and existing deep learning approaches, model\\ncomplexity is rising, necessitating more comprehensive ECG data\\nfor practical training. The recent trend of merging data from\\nseveral public ECG databases demonstrates this requirement,\\neven though it necessitates carefully evaluating variances in\\npatient demographics, measurement circumstances, and signal\\ncharacteristics.\\nFinally, a significant imbalance in data categories in current\\narrhythmia-related ECG databases, with an overrepresentation\\nof ‘normal’ categories, presents an additional hurdle. Although\\nnumerous approaches, including data augmentation ( Ma\\xa0et\\xa0al.,\\n2022) and focal loss ( Li\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2022 ), have been used to solve\\nthis problem, acquiring new data in the aberrant categories is the\\nmost practical answer. However, the practical problems connected\\nwith this approach, such as the availability of particular patient\\ngroups, highlight that the imbalance in ECG datasets remains a\\nformidable long-term challenge for researchers ( Nurmaini\\xa0et\\xa0al.,\\n2020a). T ogether, these characteristics provide insight into the\\ncomplexities of the ECG arrhythmia classification process and\\nindicate areas where further effort and innovation are needed to\\nadvance the field.\\nThe task of arrhythmia detection and classification represents\\na multifaceted multiclass classification problem. Studies utilizing\\ndatabases such as MIT-BIH, CUDB, and AFDB focused on the\\nclassification of the N, SVEB, VEB, F , and Q superclasses (refer\\nto Table\\xa02) and detection of significant types of arrhythmias\\nlike Atrial Flutter, Atrial Fibrillation (AF), and V entricular\\nFibrillation. In contrast, studies utilizing PhysioNet/CinC Challenge\\ndatasets focused on the classification and detection of AF , NSR,\\nand other rhythms by taking noise into account. Furthermore,\\nseveral studies underline the possible impact of patient-specific\\ncharacteristics on arrhythmia types, including age and gender,\\nemphasizing the significance of tailored detection and classification\\nmethodologies ( Haleem\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2021 ). As a result, this broader\\nperspective on arrhythmia classification research emphasizes the\\nmultifaceted nature of the problem and the need for tailored\\nsolutions.\\nTraditionally, CNNs are considered the top DL models for\\nECG classification due to their exceptional feature extraction\\nabilities ( Ansari\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2022a ). Meanwhile, RNNs have also\\nshown great potential in this area by catering to the time\\nseries nature of ECG signals. The advent of transformers\\nequipped with attention mechanisms represents a significant\\nprogress in DL models, with initial studies showing promising\\nresults.\\nPerformance analysis of the compiled research shows that\\nhybrid DL models, specifically transformers, perform better than\\ntraditional shallow DL models in classifying ECG arrhythmias.\\nMost hybrid DL models for arrhythmia classification use CNNs\\nas the first feature extractors, followed by more precise feature\\nextraction using additional DL structures such as RNNs and\\ntransformers (Zhu\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2022). While these hybrid models excel in\\nclassification, they increase computational complexity ( Tan\\xa0et\\xa0al.,\\nFrontiers in Physiology 15 frontiersin.org'),\n",

Currently, the\\nresearch emphasizes combining newer DL models or structures\\nfor arrhythmia classification, such as Vision Transformers (ViT)\\n(Han\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2022 ) and MLPMixer ( T olstikhin\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2021) with\\ntraditional DL models. However, this trend is in its early\\nstages.\\nIn addition, the focus on enhancing classification accuracy\\noverlooks the importance of having interpretable DL models.\\nSuch models offer clarity to the ECG classification outcomes\\nand could be highly beneficial in clinical situations. They can\\nhelp better diagnose heart irregularities and uncover concealed\\nECG signal characteristics. Incorporating DL models into other\\nartificial intelligence frameworks like active learning ( He\\xa0et\\xa0al.,\\n2022) and reinforcement learning ( Xiao\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2023b ) might\\nconsiderably improve ECG diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore,\\nsystematic optimization of DL model architectures, such as\\nconvolutional kernel sizes and hyperparameters, such as minibatch\\nsize and learning rate, should improve ECG classification\\nefficiency.\\nWhen dealing with an increased number of classification\\ncategories, the mapping relationship’ s complexity and data scarcity\\nin minority categories presents formidable challenges ( Zhao\\xa0et\\xa0al.,\\n2022). Innovative strategies such as the Hybrid Attention-Based\\nDeep Learning Network (HADLN) ( Jiang\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2021), a depthwise\\nseparable convolutional neural network with focal loss ( Lu\\xa0et\\xa0al.,\\n2021), and a novel approach for atrial fibrillation classification based\\non the 2D representation of minimal subset ECG ( Zhang\\xa0et\\xa0al.,\\n2023) have shown promise in addressing these challenges. Exploring\\nsuch strategies and pushing the bounds of hybrid models might\\nenhance the learning capabilities of the DL process, allowing for\\ncorrect classification performance for even more categories. The\\npath towards improving the state-of-the-art in ECG arrhythmia\\nclassification and detection seems to be through constant\\ninnovation, integrating novel methods, and optimizing existing\\nones.\\n7 Guideline\\nW e propose a comprehensive, systematic, and standardized\\nworkflow pipeline that is instrumental in furthering research\\nactivities, addressing prior limitations, and standardizing the clinical\\nevaluation process. This pipeline serves as a cardinal guide for\\nresearchers when developing and evaluating deep learning (DL)\\nmodels specifically for heartbeat arrhythmia classification. It is\\ncrucial to stress that these recommendations work best in heartbeat\\nclassification settings when feature extraction and classification are\\ncarried out in discrete steps. Different issues may apply, requiring a\\nchanged strategy, for detection systems incorporating arrhythmias\\nlike AF or VF , which require segments as input and permit end-to-\\nend learning.\\n1. Database selection stage:\\n• Use the standard MIT-BIH database, which includes the\\nsuggested standard metrics. This choice allows for impartial\\ncomparisons with previous studies.\\n• Examine the model’ s generalization capabilities by\\nincluding the INCART database into the assessment\\nprocedure (Llamedo and Martínez, 2010).\\n2. Preprocessing stage:\\n• Use standard signal filtering techniques to permit direct\\ncomparisons with current literature.\\n• Employ the unfiltered raw signal as the ground truth to\\ncorrectly assess the model’ s performance.\\n3. Segmentation stage:\\n• Introduce jitter to the R-location annotation throughout the\\nassessment procedure to measure the model’ s robustness\\n(Llamedo and Martínez, 2010).\\n4. Feature extraction stage:\\n• Utilize state-of-the-art feature selectors to extract salient\\nfeatures ( Pudil\\xa0et\\xa0al., 1994 ; Llamedo and Martínez, 2010 ;\\nMar\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2011; Zhang\\xa0et\\xa0al., 2014).\\n• The use of class-oriented feature selection can\\nprovide useful insights into selecting significant\\nfeatures for various forms of arrhythmia ( Zhang\\xa0et\\xa0al.,\\n2014).\\n5. Classification stage:\\n• Implement a k-fold cross-validation training pipeline to\\nensure unbiased model training.\\n• Address dataset imbalances associated with certain\\nheartbeat types by using data augmentation techniques\\nor specialized classifiers such as LSTM networks.\\n6. Evaluation stage:\\n• Employ standardized metrics to enable fair and unbiased\\ncomparisons between the proposed methodology and\\nexisting literature.\\nIn summary, the extensive exploration of deep learning and\\nmachine learning techniques, combined with novel methods such\\nas knowledge distillation and feature vector optimization, have\\nshown encouraging results in arrhythmia detection. Despite the\\nencountered limitations, these studies demonstrate the promise\\nof DL methods for ECG signal classification. These innovative\\napproaches offer novel solutions and show considerable potential\\nfor further development. Future research should address these\\nlimitations, including the development of personalized detection\\nand classification methods, balanced and comprehensive datasets,\\noptimal selection schemes of model parameters, and the effective\\nincorporation of necessary components like denoising and\\naugmentation to achieve superior performance.

There are several types of arrhythmia including atrial ﬁbrillation,\\npremature contraction, ventricular ﬁbrillation, and tachycardia. Although sin-\\ngle arrhythmia heartbeat may not have a serious impact on life, continuous\\narrhythmia beats can result in fatal circumstances.

Traditionally, it is divided into two steps, including the step of feature extraction\\nand the step of pattern classiﬁcation. Owing to recent advances in artiﬁcial intelligence, it has been\\ndemonstrated that deep neural network, which trained on a huge amount of data, can carry out the task\\nof feature extraction directly from the data and recognize cardiac arrhythmias better than professional\\ncardiologists. This paper proposes an ECG arrhythmia classiﬁcation method using two-dimensional (2D)\\ndeep convolutional neural network (CNN).

Therefore, we recommend considering\\nother evaluation metrics such as AUC or the average sensitivity when using\\nthe early stopping scheme in ECG arrhythmia classiﬁcation with CNN model.\\nFig. 7 Evaluation Graphs\\nFor more detailed comparison between the proposed CNN, AlexNet, and\\nVGGNet, Table 8, Table 9, and Table 10 describe the confusion matrix of each'),\n",
